                <p>My name is Dana, I am 22 years old and I'm originally from Germany. I wanted to move to Finland ever since I was 14 years old.
                    Like most of the German people who want to move to Finland, it started with the Finnish Rock/Pop band Sunrise Avenue. 
                    I've learned more about the country after I knew they were Finnish, but it developed into an individual love pretty fast.

                <h3>Family life</h3>
                <h6>About my family and how and where I grew up</h6>
                <p>I was born in Bremen, which is pretty much located in northern Germany. I grew up with my parents and my two brothers who are 2,5 years older and younger than me, thus I am the middle child.</p>

                <h3>Study life</h3>
                <h6>What I study and plan to continue studying</h6>
                <p>After school I went to another Finnish school (Jyväskylän normaalikoulun lukio) for 4,5 months.
                    There I decided that I wanted to try out something with Computers. I started my Digital Media studies in 2020.
                    Right now I'm in my fifth semester of that study program and currently studying as an exchange student at LUT University in Lappeenranta.<br>
                    I'm also planning to do my masters in Computer Science at some university in Finland.

                <h3>Free time</h3>
                <h6>About my hobbies and skills</h6>
                <p>In my free time I love to make and listen to music. I have played the guitar since I was six years old. Later I also started playing piano, clarinet and sang in a choir (and alone in my room).
                    I also like to skate (with roller blades) and recently discovered ice skating as well. In general, I like winter sports more than other activities.<br>
                    Since I've dreamt of moving to Finland for a very long time, I also enjoy learning the language.
